The Business Task
As a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team, I was asked to analyze the available open smart device data to gain insight into consumers usage of their smart devices. As part of my tasks, I have to apply my insights on one of the Bellabeat’s exsiting products for the future marketing campaign.
